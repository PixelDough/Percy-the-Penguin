Attack Mechanic
- Percy throws a snow ball forward to try and stun enemies.  
- While an enemy is stunned, Percy must pass by them, wrapping them into a present and 
sending it up to Santa.
- If an enemy attacks the snowball, then it cancels Percy's snowball attack.

Enemy Ideas
- Tank that shoots snowballs at you horizontally
- Icicle that kills / freezes you
- Winter Warlock that freezes you and teleports around
- Bouncer the Beach Ball.

TODO
- Add more stages (5 per new enemy)
